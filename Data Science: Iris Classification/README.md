The Iris Dataset contains four features (length and width of sepals and petals) of 50 samples of three species of Iris (Iris setosa, Iris virginica and Iris versicolor). These measures were used to create a linear discriminant model to classify the species.

In this project, I trained a K Nearest Neighbor model with 70% of the iris dataset, using N = 3, and then trained the model using grid search to get the best value for N from 3 to 10. I used the model to predict the 30% test data from the dataset and predict external data as well and I evaluated the results of each instance. Arigato!
