A web automation and scraping project integrating Python Selenium and bs4 modules.

This project is an automated home/apartment search for apartments in the UK on one of the most prominent home finding websites in the UK.
It returns the apartment address, rent pcm, apartment description and links to contact the property manager.

I took up this project due to my keen interest in Real Estate. Arigato!
