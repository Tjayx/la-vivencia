Log: 
This is the first web scraper I've ever written(using the beautifulsoup and pandas module). 
The keep_alive code was to keep the main code running on Replit whenever there's a network break. 
This web scraper grabs all Japanese anime in cartoonsarea.com under categories A through Z; names, year released, status, number of episodes in total, total size, total time in minutes, average size per episode and average time per episode. 
NB: some anime have incongruous data and this is due to repeated episodes on the website, absent data on the website or incoherent format with other anime in other and same letter categories i.e if the arrangement on the website were to have been ordered similarly respective to each anime, this code would've grabbed accurate data. Not withstanding exceptions could've been written to correct these errors as some were actually corrected but to avoid ambiguity in the code, this was neglected as this is a non profit project. 
Modifications to this code would be much appreciated, Arigato. 
On to the next, ikuzoo!
